*** PRIORITY ***
- Changing User details to input type fields so we can update user details
- Add a new item
- Fetching all items in the system
- Fetching item details per item id
- Updating item details if need be
- Changing status of item details onClick

**** BACK LOG ***
- cancel button on AddProdComp.js should reroute to UsersComp.js
- after adding a new user, currently need to refresh to get new list ( will need to refactor how and when the usersComp re-renders)
- refactor, refactor, refactor (code was put together quickly for functionality, it is not DRY or optimal)
- make website responsive
- fix the fact that web page scrolls slightly on the admin side, and that the window doesn't go down to bottom of screen
- have data verification for phone numbers being 10 numbers long and formatting (x-xxx-xxx-xxxx)the input before it gets to database
- formatting date coming from back end to yyyy-mm-dd format ... currently showing Fri 01, Mar 2019 00:00GMT when it comes back from database
